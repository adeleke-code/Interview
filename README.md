Color Analysis Program
This program analyzes the colors of dresses worn by Bincom staff throughout the week and provides answers to various questions. It is implemented in Python 3.11.

Features
Mean Color: Calculates the mean color of the dresses worn throughout the week.
Most Worn Color: Determines the color that is worn the most throughout the week.
Median Color: Identifies the median color among the dresses worn throughout the week.
Variance Calculation: Calculates the variance of the colors worn throughout the week.
Probability of Red Color: Determines the probability of choosing a red color randomly from the dresses worn.
Database Storage: Saves the colors and their frequencies in a PostgreSQL database.
Recursive Searching Algorithm: Implements a recursive algorithm to search for a user-entered number in a list of numbers.
Binary Number Conversion: Generates a random 4-digit binary number and converts it to base 10.
Fibonacci Sequence Sum: Calculates the sum of the first 50 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Implementation Details
The program utilizes Python's standard libraries, including re for pattern matching, statistics for statistical calculations, random for random number generation, and psycopg2 for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

The analysis of the colors is performed by extracting the color data from the provided web page using regular expressions. The extracted colors are then processed and analyzed according to the specified requirements.

Usage
To run the program, ensure you have Python 3.11 installed. You may use any IDE or execute the program from the command line. Make sure you have the required libraries (re, statistics, random, and psycopg2) installed.

Please note that the bonus questions are not required but are recommended for a more comprehensive analysis. The program outputs the results of the analysis and saves the color frequencies to a PostgreSQL database.

Conclusion
This Python program effectively analyzes the colors of dresses worn by Bincom staff throughout the week. It provides answers to various questions, calculates statistical measures, and offers additional bonus features. The program demonstrates proficiency in basic programming skills, web scraping, data analysis, and database interaction using Python 3.11.
